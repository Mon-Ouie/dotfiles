Welcome to the Java IDE for Emacs, an Emacs-based integrated development
environment for developing Java applications. Features include:

  * source code editing with syntax highlighting and
    auto indendation

  * compilation with automatic jump from error messages
    to responsible line in the source code.

  * run Java application in an interactive (comint)
    Emacs buffer

  * integrated debugging with interactive debug
    command buffer and automatic display of
    current source file/line when stepping through code

  * browse JDK doc, using the browser of your choice

  * browse your source code, using the Emacs etags
    facility or a tree-structured speedbar.

  * supports latest version of JavaSoft's Java Development
    Kit

  * runs on any platform supported by Emacs and Sun's
    Java SDK (e.g., Win95/NT and Solaris)

  * easily and infinitely customizable

  * works with FSF Emacs and XEmacs

The IDE integrates several Emacs program
development packages (cc-mode, gud, and
compile) with JavaSoft's JDK.

This package includes:

   -- jde.el

   -- jde-run.el

   -- jde-db.el 

   -- speedbar.el

   -- shell script that tags java files,
      using the etags program. This script
      comes in two versions, one for 
      csh and the other for bash shells.

It requires:

   -- latest version of cc-mode.el

      (available from
       ftp://ftp.python.org/pub/emacs/cc-mode.tar.gz)

   -- andersl-java-font-lock.el

      (available from
       http:\\www.csd.uu.se\~andersl\emacs.shtml
       ftp:\\ftp.csd.uu.se\pub\users\andersl\emacs\)

      This is required for syntax highlighting.

   -- Java Development Kit (jdk) 
     
      (available from
        http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp)

   -- Web browser

      (e.g., Netscape or Internet Explorer)

   -- Unix-style shell for Windows 95 or Windows/NT

      I recommend bash, available from www.cygnus.com.

To install, please read install.html in this directory.
